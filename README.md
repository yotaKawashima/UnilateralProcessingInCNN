# Do Convolutional Neural Networks show Brain-Like Unilateral Processing? 

## Overview
This project is part of the Artificial Neural Networks in Cognitive Neuroscience seminar at FU for the winter semester 2024/2025. For project information, please check [Presentation slides](https://github.com/yotaKawashima/UnilateralProcessingInCNN/blob/main/Kawashima_20241018_NeuroAISeminar%40FU.pdf).

Some of the code originates from Jupyter notebooks used in the seminar by Adrien Doerig. These notebooks were inspired by the work of Niklas MÃ¼ller for the UvA NeuroAI Summer School 2024, organized by Steven Scholte and Iris Groen at the University of Amsterdam.

## Usage
### Google Colab
You are supposed to run the project on Google Colab (GPU is not required, but it may take some time). 

### Google Drive
You need to upload the whole project directory to Google Drive. Ensure you add a shortcut to the [UvA Encoding Tutorial Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjDOejWLjfXGkr-hK07SZJ_4ni1nypjw?usp=drive_link) in the main directory. (Go to the drive, click the drive name UvA_encodingtutorial, go to 'Organise' and select 'Add shortcut'. Once done, you will see 'UvA_encodingtutorial' folder in the main directory.)

### Running the Main Script
To run the main script `run_main.ipynb`, open the file in Google Colab. Before running it, make sure to set paths correctly in the file.
