# Do Convolutional Neural Networks show Brain-Like Unilateral Processing? 

## Overview
This project is part of the Artificial Neural Networks in Cognitive Neuroscience seminar at FU for the winter semester 2024/2025. For project information, please check [Presentation slides](https://github.com/yotaKawashima/UnilateralProcessingInCNN/blob/main/Kawashima_20241018_NeuroAISeminar%40FU.pdf).


## Usage
### Google Colab
You are supposed to run the project on Google Colab (GPU is not required, but it may take some time).

### Google Drive
Ensure you add shortcut to the [UvA Encoding Tutorial Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AjDOejWLjfXGkr-hK07SZJ_4ni1nypjw?usp=drive_link) in the main directory. (Go to the drive, click the drive name UvA_encodingtutorial, go to 'Organise' and select 'Add shortcut'. Once you done it, you will see 'UvA_encodingtutorial' folder in the main directory.)

### Running the Main Script
To run the main script `run_main.ipynb`, open the file in Google Colab. Before running it, make sure to set paths correctly in the file.
